The IDHMC is proud to announce the public beta release of its new OCR training tool, Franken+! Franken+ was developed by our graduate assistant researcher, Bryan Tarpley. It is the missing link between PRIMALabs' Aletheia and Google's Tesseract OCR engine. It allows us to create pristine, historical "fonts" with which to train Tesseract.
